# SML-Kd-predictor
Learning fundamentals of deep learning architecture through predicting Kd of small molecule-protein interactions
**Features:** 
- Flash Attention 2.0
- LoRA + 8-bit quantization for memory efficiency
- ESM-2 protein encoder + ChemBERTa molecular encoder
- Physics-informed loss functions

**Next Steps:** - 
1. Implement MLOps pipeline with MLflow/W&B
2. Set up model versioning and A/B testing
3. Create REST API with FastAPI/Flask
4. Add model monitoring and drift detection
5. Implement automated retraining pipeline
6. Deploy with Docker + Kubernetes/AWS ECS
7. Set up CI/CD pipeline for model updates
